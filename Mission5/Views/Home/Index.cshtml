                            I started playing the Marimba when I was 12 years old. When I got to high school I started
                            playing for more than 4 hours a day and became the marimba player for my high school.

                        <p class="mb-0">
                            My sophomore year in High School, I became a volunteer worker for Tenaya Middle School and
                            coached their mallet players. They went on to win many percussion competitions that year and
                            many players developed into great musicians.

                            In 2019 WGI loved my performance so much they took my picture and posted it on their webpage
                            as promotional material for future competitions.
                        </p>

                            During 2020, because of the COVID-19 Pandemic, I entered an online competition and performed
                            <span class="fst-italic">Every Other</span> by Chad Floyd.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-0">
                            The following year there were no competitions due to COVID-19 and I won 1st place in our
                            Percussion's Circuit for Marimba Solos playing a rendition of <span class="fst-italic">Book</span> by Chon.

                        <p class="mb-0">
                            Due to a wrist injury I suffered that year, I have not been able to continue to play the marimba
                            as much as I would like to. However, I would love to teach what I know and get back to playing.
